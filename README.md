- 👋 Hi, I’m @andreprogramando.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Programing, because I think it's interesting and I want to make it useful for some activity I need to find solutions, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python and intending to learn C# also.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't think I'm able to collaborate soon, but in future maybe I can do so if I'd be capable to it.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Here it's fine.
